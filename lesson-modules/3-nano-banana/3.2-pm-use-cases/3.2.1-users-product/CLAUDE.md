# Module 3.2.1: Users & Product Visuals

Welcome to Module 3.2.1: Users & Product Visuals!

You've learned the fundamentals of image generation in Module 3.1. Now let's put those skills to work on real PM tasks.

Quick reminder: TaskFlow is the fictional company for this course - a B2B SaaS platform for team task management.

Here's the scenario: you're a PM at TaskFlow, and you're pitching a new mobile app to leadership next week. The app is designed for operations managers in manufacturing - people who coordinate tasks across shifts on the factory floor.

You need visuals for your pitch deck: 
- a persona portrait
- a journey map
- wireframes
- a hero image.

By the end of this module, you'll have built all of them.

STOP: Ready to start building your pitch deck visuals?

USER: Ready

---

Quick reminder - you have two ways to work with image generation:

**Option 1:** Pick a style from your `style-library.html` (e.g., "use style #9") - we introduced this in 3.1.4. Let me know if you need help accessing it.

**Option 2:** Just describe what you want and I'll figure out the rest.

Both approaches work great. Use whichever feels natural to you.

STOP: Makes sense?

USER: Yes

## Part 1: Persona Portrait

First things first - every good pitch starts with "who are we building for?"

Let's create a persona portrait for your pitch deck.

Meet Marcus Chen. He's an operations manager at a manufacturing plant. He manages 3 shift supervisors and needs to track tasks across the factory floor. Mid-40s, practical, always has his phone in one hand and a coffee in the other.

STOP: Ask me to create a persona portrait of Marcus for your pitch deck.

USER: Create a persona portrait of Marcus / Generate Marcus Chen

ACTION: Generate persona portrait of Marcus Chen
- Operations manager, mid-40s, manufacturing environment
- Confident but approachable expression
- Wearing practical work attire (polo or button-down, maybe safety vest)
- Use a style appropriate for pitch decks (professional but not stock-photo sterile)
- Save to outputs folder with descriptive name

ACTION: Provide the path to the output image so user can view it.

Open the `outputs/` folder to see Marcus.

STOP: What do you think? Does he look like someone who runs a factory floor?

USER: Response

That's your "who we're building for" slide sorted.

STOP: Ready to show leadership what Marcus's day looks like?

USER: Yes

---

## Part 2: Journey Map

A journey map shows the pain points we're solving. Let's map Marcus's morning workflow - this is where TaskFlow Mobile helps most.

His morning goes something like this:
- **6 AM:** Arrives, checks overnight shift handoff notes
- **6:30 AM:** Reviews task backlog, assigns priorities for day shift
- **7 AM:** Morning standup with shift supervisors
- **8-11 AM:** Walks the floor, tracks task completion, handles issues
- **11:30 AM:** Prepares handoff notes for afternoon shift

Currently, he does all this with a clipboard, a radio, and scattered text messages. It's chaos.

STOP: Ask me to create a journey map showing Marcus's morning workflow.

USER: Create a journey map / Generate the journey map

ACTION: Generate journey map visualization
- Marcus's morning workflow from 6 AM to noon
- Show stages: Arrive → Review → Standup → Floor Walk → Handoff
- Include pain points at each stage (scattered info, manual tracking, delayed updates)
- Clean, presentation-ready style (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Save to outputs folder with descriptive name

ACTION: Provide the path to the output image so user can view it.

Check the `outputs/` folder for your journey map.

STOP: See how it visualizes the problem you're solving?

USER: Response

---

Remember: you can always ask for changes.

Don't like the style? Just ask - "make it more playful" or "try a hand-drawn look."

You can also reference the style library - for example, "regenerate this using style #59" for an illustrated version.

STOP: Want to try a different style, or are you happy with this one?

USER: Response (either asks for change or continues)

ACTION: If user wants a change, regenerate with their requested style. If they're satisfied, continue to the next section.

Now here's a power move: we can put Marcus INSIDE the journey map.

We have Marcus's portrait from earlier. We can use it as a reference image and generate a journey map that shows him at each stage of his morning.

STOP: Ask me to regenerate the journey map with Marcus in it.

USER: Regenerate with Marcus / Put Marcus in the journey map

ACTION: Generate journey map with Marcus as a character at each stage
- Use the Marcus portrait image as a reference image
- Describe his visual details in the prompt: mid-40s, navy polo, safety vest
- Same 5 stages: Arrive → Review → Standup → Floor Walk → Handoff
- Show Marcus himself at each stage performing the activity
- Include pain points at each stage
- Clean infographic style, 16:9 aspect ratio
- Save to outputs folder

ACTION: Provide the path to the output image so user can view it.

Check `outputs/` for the updated journey map.

STOP: See how Marcus appears consistently across all stages? That's the session memory at work.

USER: Response

---

This is the kind of artifact that makes presentations memorable. It's not just a generic journey map - it's Marcus's story.

STOP: Ready to show leadership what the solution looks like? Next up: wireframes

USER: Yes

---

## Part 3: Wireframe Transformation

Here's a common PM scenario: you sketched an idea in a meeting and now you need to make it presentable.

ACTION: Get the absolute path to `hand-drawn-wireframe.jpg` in this module folder.

Open this file to see it: [provide the path]

This is your "meeting sketch" - a quick wireframe you drew while thinking about Marcus's needs.

STOP: Do you see the sketch? Notice the TaskFlow header, the shift overview, the task assignments?

USER: Yes, I see it

---

Now let's transform this rough sketch into a polished wireframe for your pitch deck.

STOP: Ask me to transform this hand-drawn sketch into a clean, polished wireframe.

USER: Transform this into a polished wireframe / Clean up this sketch

ACTION: Generate polished wireframe using hand-drawn-wireframe.jpg as reference
- Transform the rough sketch into a clean, professional wireframe
- Keep the same layout and elements (header, greeting, task list, shift overview, nav)
- Clean lines, consistent spacing, professional typography
- Mobile screen aspect ratio (9:16 or similar)
- Save to outputs folder with descriptive name

ACTION: Provide the path to the output image so user can view it.

Check the `outputs/` folder - you should see your polished wireframe.

STOP: Compare the sketch to the polished version. See how it preserved your ideas but made them presentation-ready?

USER: Response

In minutes, you went from meeting sketch to pitch-ready wireframe.

STOP: Ready to make it look even more real?

USER: Yes

---

## Part 4: Device Mockup

Wireframes are great, but stakeholders love seeing the app "in a phone." It makes everything feel more real.

Let's put your polished wireframe into an iPhone frame.

STOP: Ask me to put the wireframe into an iPhone mockup.

USER: Put this in an iPhone / Create a device mockup

ACTION: Generate device mockup with a realistic UI (not wireframe)
- iPhone frame (modern model), direct head-on view (not angled)
- Transform the wireframe concept into a polished, realistic app UI with real colors, icons, and typography
- Clean background (white or subtle gradient)
- Slight shadow for depth
- Professional, pitch-deck ready
- Save to outputs folder with descriptive name

ACTION: Provide the path to the output image so user can view it.

Check the `outputs/` folder for your device mockup.

STOP: Now it looks like a real app, right?

USER: Response

Perfect for your pitch deck - but we can go one step further.

STOP: Ready to create the hero image?

USER: Yes

---

## Part 5: Lifestyle Shot

The hero image is what sells the vision.

Let's show Marcus actually using TaskFlow on the factory floor. This brings everything together: your persona, in their environment, using your product.

STOP: Ask me to create a lifestyle shot of Marcus using TaskFlow on the factory floor.

USER: Create a lifestyle shot / Show Marcus using the app on the factory floor

ACTION: Generate lifestyle shot
- Marcus (operations manager, mid-40s) on a manufacturing floor
- Holding phone showing TaskFlow interface
- Factory environment in background (equipment, workers, industrial setting)
- Natural lighting, authentic feel
- Composition suitable for a hero image or pitch deck cover
- Save to outputs folder with descriptive name

ACTION: Provide the path to the output image so user can view it.

Check the `outputs/` folder for your hero image.

STOP: This is your pitch deck cover right here. What do you think?

USER: Response

---

## Wrap-Up

Let's recap what you just built:

1. **A persona portrait** of Marcus Chen
2. **A journey map** of his morning workflow
3. **A polished wireframe** transformed from a rough sketch
4. **A device mockup** showing the app in an iPhone
5. **A hero image** of Marcus using TaskFlow on the factory floor

That's a complete visual narrative for a product pitch - built in minutes.

These same techniques work for any PM scenario: user research presentations, stakeholder updates, product reviews. Whenever you need visuals, you now have the skills to create them.

STOP: Any questions before we move on?

USER: Questions or ready to continue

---

In the next module, we'll tackle strategy and architecture visuals - diagrams, frameworks, and system overviews.

Type `/start-3-2-2` to continue.

## Important Notes for Claude

- **File paths:** Always provide absolute paths when telling users where to find files.
- **Image generation:** Use the `image_gen.py` module via Python. Start a new session at the beginning of each major generation to keep sessions clean.
- **Style library:** If user references a style number, look up the prompt in `style-library.html` (in the 3.1.4 module folder).
- **Iteration:** If any image doesn't turn out well, offer to regenerate or refine it. Use the session to iterate.
- **Output naming:** Use descriptive names like `marcus_chen_persona.png`, `morning_workflow_journey_map.png`, etc.
- **Opening images:** If a user is having trouble finding an image, offer to open it for them using `open [path]` (Mac) or `start [path]` (Windows).
